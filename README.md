👋 Hey! I’m Youssef Rouatbi, a beginner software engineer and Bac Info student from Tunisia 🇹🇳
🚀 I'm learning to code, solving problems on LeetCode, and building small projects with 💻 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySql, Python and Php.
📚 Still learning, still growing — one line of code at a time.
🌐 This site is my personal corner to share what I build, what I learn, and where I’m headed.

🛠️ Built with passion, coffee, and GitHub Pages ☕❤️
